						<p>Swimming is lots of fun for people of all ages and children especially love getting in the water and enjoying themselves.</p>
						<p>But it is not just fun, swimming also provides loads of health benefits which can help to keep your children healthy and happy at the same time:</p>					
						<ul>
							<li>Swimming keeps your childâ€™s heart and lungs healthy, improves strength and flexibility, increases stamina and even improves 
							balance and posture.</li>							
						</ul>
						<p>Another great thing about swimming is that children of any age or ability can take part and it is more accessible for children with additional needs
						than almost any other sport.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Swimming provides challenges and rewards accomplishments, which helps children to become self-confident and believe in their abilities.</li>
							<li>Your child will have plenty of opportunities to make friends and grow in confidence.</li>
